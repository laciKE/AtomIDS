The holder is designed to fit exactly the holes in the [IKEA Trotten Desk sit/stand, 160x80 cm](https://www.ikea.com/cz/en/p/trotten-desk-sit-stand-white-s79429602/). There are two positions how the desk adjustment mechanism can be assembled (on the right or left). Then there are spare holes under the back side of the desk, and this 3D model fits exactly those screw holes.
